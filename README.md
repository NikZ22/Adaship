Nikita Zyrianov's submission for Advanced Programming module Week 2 Coursework
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Synopsis
-
This project was created using the Visual Studio open source software that
includes loads of prebuilt libraries specifically designed to create desktop
applications that include a GUI (a windowed application). This is how I attempted
to solve this challenge in C++. I understand that other programming languages have
a friendlier learning curve and will let me meet the criteria of this challenge
quicker but I wish to challenge myself and see what I could accomplish in the
3 weeks given to do this challenge.
